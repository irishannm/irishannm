# Hello there!
*"Testing is not just finding bugs — it’s building confidence in the product."*

## About Me  
Irish Ann here! I started my journey in QA Testing during my internship, where I was exposed to various Agile practices such as early feedback and the iterative approach to delivering sprints.  
I later realized that the role perfectly fits my characteristics as someone who adapts quickly and is proactive.  
Eventually, I landed a job as a Quality Assurance Analyst, working on diverse projects ranging from gaming sites to back-office systems.
